In addition to the configurations used for Umbraco, we also provide other configurations for backoffice and language customization:

# 4.1 Configuration Remember Language - Culture and Hostnames
We do provide multilingual configuration by **cookie**. This defaults Umbraco to support multilingual only! You can find our **"Culture and Hostnames"** settings in the "Home" node (_**uTPro -> Sites -> Home**_)

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure that the default language (first access user has no cookie and url has no language set) is set to END "/" by default and set it to the last position (In the picture we are using Vietnamese as the default language). Make sure each language has a hostname for Remember Language to work properly.

You can disable this feature by setting **Enabled: "false"** for **RememberLanguage**:

# 4.2 Configuration Backoffice and Website run separately
You can separate Backoffice and Website into 2 separate domains, if you have enabled and configured the domain for Backoffice, try accessing the Website domain and "/umbraco" to see the result.
